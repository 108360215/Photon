# What is Photon?
Photon is a simple Monte-Carlo path tracer made out of my personal interest in computer graphics. I read many brilliant ideas and concepts from a group of awesome people on the Internet and try to implement some of them in my free time. The development is still in progress and I'm learning from it. Last but not least, I hope that I can improve the rendering quality of Photon more and more, and eventually discover the secrets of the Universe...
