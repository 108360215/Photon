# What is Photon?
Photon is a simple Monte-Carlo path tracer made out of my personal interest in computer graphics. I read many brilliant ideas and concepts from a group of awesome people on the Internet and tried to implement some of them in my free time. Also, the development is still in progress and I am learning from it ([Photon-v2](https://github.com/TzuChieh/Photon-v2/) is the current version). Last but not least, I hope that I can improve the rendering quality of Photon more and more and eventually discover the secrets of the Universe... <br />
